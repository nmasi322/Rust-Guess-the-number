## Guess the Number (Rust)

This is a guess the number game built with rust. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess it. I built this with the "rand" crate.

Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/nmasi322/Rust-Guess-the-number.git` Then in your terminal run cargo run (if you have rust installed). Have fun! 💸😁
